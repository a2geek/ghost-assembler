The <code>.org</code> directive indicates which memory locations the assembler should begin with when assembling code. 
There can be multiple <code>.org</code> directives in the source file.

Example:
</p>
<pre>
   .org 0x300
</pre>

Note that this may interact with the <code>.cpu</code> directive if that particular CPU has some form of signature bytes
that are required at the beginning of the file.
