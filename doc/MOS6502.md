# MOS6502


The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology
in 1975. When it was introduced it was the least expensive full-featured CPU on the market by
far, at about 1/6th the price, or less, of competing designs from larger companies such as
Motorola and Intel. It was nevertheless faster than most of them, and, along with the Zilog Z80,
sparked off a series of computer projects* that would eventually result in the home computer
revolution of the 1980s. The 6502 design was originally second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek
and later licensed to a number of companies; it is still made for embedded systems.

## Registers

| Name | ID | Bits | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | :--- |
| Accumulator Register (A) | A | 8 | The Accumulator Register (A) is an 8-bit general purpose register whichholds one of the operands and the result of arithmetic and logicaloperations. Reconfigured versions of this processor family could haveadditional accumulators. |
| Index Register | X | 8 | There are two 8-bit Index Registers (X and Y) which may be used as generalpurpose registers or to provide an index value for calculation of theeffective address. When executing an instruction with indexed addressing,the microprocessor fetches the OpCode and the base address, and thenmodifies the address by adding the Index Register contents to the addressprior to performing the desired operation. |
| Index Register | Y | 8 | There are two 8-bit Index Registers (X and Y) which may be used as generalpurpose registers or to provide an index value for calculation of theeffective address. When executing an instruction with indexed addressing,the microprocessor fetches the OpCode and the base address, and thenmodifies the address by adding the Index Register contents to the addressprior to performing the desired operation. |

## Addressing Modes

| Title | ID | Format | Bytes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Implied | implied |  | 1 | Implied addressing uses a single byte instruction. The operand isimplicitly defined by the instruction. |
| Accumulator | accumulator |  | 1 | With Accumulator addressing the operand is implied as the Accumulator andtherefore only a single byte forms the instruction.. |
| Immediate Addressing | immediate | #value | 2 | With Immediate Addressing the operand is the second byte of theinstruction. |
| Zero Page Indexed with X | zero-page-indexed-x | zp,X | 2 | With Zero Page Indexed with X addressing mode, the X Index Register isadded to the second byte of instruction to form the effective address. |
| Zero Page Indexed with Y | zero-page-indexed-y | zp,Y | 2 | With Zero Page Indexed with Y addressing, the second byte of theinstruction is the Zero Page address to which the Y Index Register isadded to form the page zero effective address. |
| Absolute Indexed with X | absolute-indexed-x | addr,X | 3 | With the Absolute Indexed with X addressing mode, the X Index Register isadded to the second and third bytes of the instruction to form the 16-bitsof the effective address. |
| Absolute Indexed with Y | absolute-indexed-y | addr,Y | 3 | With the Absolute Indexed with Y addressing mode, the Y Index Register isadded to the second and third bytes of the instruction to form the 16-biteffective address. |
| Absolute Indirect | absolute-indirect | (addr) | 3 | With the Absolute Indirect addressing mode, the second and third bytes ofthe instruction form an address to a pointer. This address mode is onlyused with the JMP instruction and the Program Counter is loaded with thefirst and second bytes at this pointer. |
| Zero Page Indexed Indirect | zero-page-indirect-x | (addr,X) | 2 | The Zero Page Indexed Indirect addressing mode is often referred to asIndirect,X. The second byte of the instruction is the Zero Page address towhich the X Index Register is added and the result points to the low byteof the indirect address. |
| Zero Page Indirect Indexed with Y | zero-page-indirect-y | (addr),Y | 2 | The Zero Page Indirect Indexed with Y addressing mode is often referred toas Indirect Y. The second byte of the instruction points to the low byteof a two byte (16-bit) base address in page zero. Y Index Register isadded to the base address to form the effective address. |
| Zero Page zp | zero-page | zp | 2 | With Zero Page (zp) addressing the second byte of the instruction is theaddress of the operand in page zero. |
| Program Counter Relative | relative | addr | 2 | The Program Counter relative addressing mode, sometimes referred to asRelative Addressing, is used with the Branch instructions. If thecondition being tested is met, the second byte of the instruction is addedto the Program Counter and program control is transferred to this newmemory location. |
| Absolute | absolute | addr | 3 | With Absolute addressing the second and third bytes of the instructionform the 16-bit address. |
