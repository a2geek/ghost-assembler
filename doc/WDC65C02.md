# WDC65C02


The WDC 65C02 8-bit CPU is an upgraded CMOS version of the popular MOS Technology 6502
microprocessor, the redesign being made by Bill Mensch of the Western Design Center (WDC).
The 65C02 was second-sourced by NCR, GTE, Rockwell, Synertek and Sanyo.

## Registers

| Name | ID | Bits | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | :--- |
| Accumulator Register (A) | A | 8 | The Accumulator Register (A) is an 8-bit general purpose register whichholds one of the operands and the result of arithmetic and logicaloperations. Reconfigured versions of this processor family could haveadditional accumulators. |
| Index Register | X | 8 | There are two 8-bit Index Registers (X and Y) which may be used as generalpurpose registers or to provide an index value for calculation of theeffective address. When executing an instruction with indexed addressing,the microprocessor fetches the OpCode and the base address, and thenmodifies the address by adding the Index Register contents to the addressprior to performing the desired operation. |
| Index Register | Y | 8 | There are two 8-bit Index Registers (X and Y) which may be used as generalpurpose registers or to provide an index value for calculation of theeffective address. When executing an instruction with indexed addressing,the microprocessor fetches the OpCode and the base address, and thenmodifies the address by adding the Index Register contents to the addressprior to performing the desired operation. |

## Addressing Modes

| Title | ID | Format | Bytes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zero Page Indirect | zero-page-indirect | (zp) | 2 | With Zero Page Indirect addressing mode, the second byte of theinstruction is a zero page indirect address that points to the low byte ofa two byte effective address. |
| Absolute Indexed Indirect | absolute-indexed-indirect-x | (addr,X) | 3 | With the Absolute Indexed Indirect addressing mode, the X Index Registeris added to the second and third byes of the instruction to form anaddress to a pointer. This address mode is only used with the JMPinstruction and the program Counter is loaded with the first and secondbytes at this pointer. |
| Implied | implied |  | 1 | Implied addressing uses a single byte instruction. The operand isimplicitly defined by the instruction. |
| Accumulator | accumulator |  | 1 | With Accumulator addressing the operand is implied as the Accumulator andtherefore only a single byte forms the instruction.. |
| Immediate Addressing | immediate | #value | 2 | With Immediate Addressing the operand is the second byte of theinstruction. |
| Zero Page Indexed with X | zero-page-indexed-x | zp,X | 2 | With Zero Page Indexed with X addressing mode, the X Index Register isadded to the second byte of instruction to form the effective address. |
| Zero Page Indexed with Y | zero-page-indexed-y | zp,Y | 2 | With Zero Page Indexed with Y addressing, the second byte of theinstruction is the zero page address to which the Y Index Register isadded to form the page zero effective address. |
| Absolute Indexed with X | absolute-indexed-x | addr,X | 3 | With the Absolute Indexed with X addressing mode, the X Index Register isadded to the second and third bytes of the instruction to form the 16-bitsof the effective address. |
| Absolute Indexed with Y | absolute-indexed-y | addr,Y | 3 | With the Absolute Indexed with Y addressing mode, the Y Index Register isadded to the second and third bytes of the instruction to form the 16-biteffective address. |
| Absolute Indirect | absolute-indirect | (addr) | 3 | With the Absolute Indirect addressing mode, the second and third bytes ofthe instruction form an address to a pointer. This address mode is onlyused with the JMP instruction and the Program Counter is loaded with thefirst and second bytes at this pointer. |
| Zero Page Indexed Indirect | zero-page-indirect-x | (addr,X) | 2 | The Zero Page Indexed Indirect addressing mode is often referred to asIndirect,X. The second byte of the instruction is the zero page address towhich the X Index Register is added and the result points to the low byteof the indirect address. |
| Zero Page Indirect Indexed with Y | zero-page-indirect-y | (addr),Y | 2 | The Zero Page Indirect Indexed with Y addressing mode is often referred toas Indirect Y. The second byte of the instruction points to the low byteof a two byte (16-bit) base address in page zero. Y Index Register isadded to the base address to form the effective address. |
| Zero Page zp | zero-page | zp | 2 | With Zero Page (zp) addressing the second byte of the instruction is theaddress of the operand in page zero. |
| Program Counter Relative | relative | addr | 2 | The Program Counter relative addressing mode, sometimes referred to asRelative Addressing, is used with the Branch instructions. If thecondition being tested is met, the second byte of the instruction is addedto the Program Counter and program control is transferred to this newmemory location. |
| Absolute | absolute | addr | 3 | With Absolute addressing the second and third bytes of the instructionform the 16-bit address. |
