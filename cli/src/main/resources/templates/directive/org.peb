The `.org` directive indicates which memory locations the assembler should begin with when assembling code. 
There can be multiple `.org` directives in the source file.

Example:

```
.org 0x300
```

Note that this may interact with the `.cpu` directive if that particular CPU has some form of signature bytes
that are required at the beginning of the file.
