# Ghost Assembler

This is a repurposing of an old Java assembler that allows dynamic instruction sets. Note that 
there will be a lot of initial repurposing of components, upgrading, and migrations before it 
becomes useful. The initial purpose is to utilize it within the 
[Ghost in the Stack VM](https://github.com/a2geek/ghost-in-the-stack-vm) and it's BASIC compiler.
