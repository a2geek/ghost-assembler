# Ghost Assembler

This is a repurposing of an old Java assmebler that allows dynamic instruction sets. Note that there will be a lot of initial repurposing of components, upgrading, and migrations before it becomes useful. The initial purpose is to utilize it within the [Ghost in the Stack VM](a2geek/ghost-in-the-stack-vm) and it's BASIC compiler.
